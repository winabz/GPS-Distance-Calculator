# GPS-Distance-Calculator

Imports GPS coordinates from places.csv if no optional integer argument is given and calculates distances between all pairs of points with those coordinates.
If argument is given it determines how many random points will be generated. Optional integer argument shouldn't be -1, 0 or 1, because there should be at least one pair generated.
