# GPS-Distance-Calculator for linux
Calculates distances between points with GPS coordinates

works on linux.
launch PATH./distance_calculator 3(optional)

Imports GPS coordinates from places.csv if no optional integer argument is given and calculates distances between all pairs of points with those coordinates.
Optional integer argument shouldn't be -1, 0 or 1, because it determines how many random points will be generated and we need at least two points to make a pair. 

Works in command-line with one optional integer argument.
