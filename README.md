# GPS-Distance-Calculator
Calculates distances between points with GPS coordinates


Imports GPS coordinates from places.csv if no optional integer argument is given and calculates distances between all pairs of points with those coordinates.
Optional integer argument shouldn't be -1, 0 or 1, because we need at least two points.

Works in command-line with one optional integer argument.
